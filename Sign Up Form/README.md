Problem: 
	Implement a sign-up form in HTML with the following six imput fields, each with an appropriate label:
	1) username,
	2) Password,
	3) Email,
	4) Phone Number,
	5) Date of Birth,
	6) I agree to the TOS
Make as many of the labels "required" as you want.

Obviously submitting wont do anything and thats okay :) We are all learning here!
